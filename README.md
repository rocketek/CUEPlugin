CUE Plugin
==========

This Rhythmbox plugin is designed to read CUE sheets. **The CUE Plugin looks for a CUE file that shares the same name as the currently playing audio file and is located in the same directory.** As a result, when you play an audio file, a window displaying separate tracks appears, allowing you to play any of them by double clicking on the desired track.

Installation instructions:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/rocketek/CUEPlugin.git
cd CUEPlugin
./install.sh
</pre>

Enable the plugin in 'Preferences->Plugins->CUE Plugin'
